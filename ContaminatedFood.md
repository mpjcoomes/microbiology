*Bacterial examination of water & microbiology of food*
====

ABSTRACT
====

This study aimed to examine the bacterial count of a water sample and of six food samples. Membrane filtration and incubation showed total colony forming units (cfu), Coliforms and non-Coliforms of the water sample. Counts exceeded Australian guidelines for Coliform and non-Coliform cfu in Endo and KF Streptococcus Agar. Pour plates showed contamination for salami, vegetables, raw milk, chicken mince and soft cheese food samples. Further incubation in Chromocult Coliform Agar revealed presence of E. coli in milk and chicken, and along with vegetables, contamination with Coliforms and non-Coliforms. Salami and cheese presented with pathogenic Staphylococci on Baird-Parker and Mannitol Salt Agar. Hektoen Enteric and XLD Agar identified Salmonella in milk and chicken, Shigella in cream cake and cheese. Future research should pursue time series analysis and why Shigella was the only bacteria to present in the cake sample.

INTRODUCTION
====

Developing countries are at risk of waterborne infections from Cholera, Typhoid and other bacteria (Madigan et al., 2010, p. 1013). Foodborne infections require lower bacterial concentrations than water and occur worldwide in raw and contaminated food (Madigan et al., 2010, p. 1039). The aim of this paper was to assess water and food samples for bacterial content and compare them to Australian standards.

Coliform and Enterococci bacterial groups are indicators of contamination. Coliforms are gram-negative facultative anaerobes that ferment lactose into acid and produce gas. Enterococci are gram-positive bacteria, common in the human intestinal tract. Both may be pathogenic when consumed in colony-forming unit (cfu) concentrations above safe guidelines.

Contamination can be measured using plate counts off filtration membranes exposed to water samples. Some suitable incubation mediums include Plate Count Agar, Endo Agar, KF Streptococcus Agar (Kenner, Clark, & Kabler, 1961). Plate Count Agar is used to measure total colony counts, as it is nutrient rich and conducive to growth for most bacteria. Endo Agar is sensitive to Coliforms and such colonies appear red. The addition of fuchsin-sulphite allows E. coli to be separated from counts, as the aldehyde it produces reacts to form a fuchsin greenish metallic surface. KF Streptococcus Agar measures Enterococci counts, as colonies will also be red yet the possible bacteria are limited by the high sodium. Total, Coliform and Enterococci counts were hypothesised to be in excess of Australian Guidelines for Microbiological Quality of Water.

Food samples studied within this paper included salami, vegetables, raw milk, chicken mince, cream cake and soft cheese. Plate Count Agar may be used with food, as above with water, to calculate total cfu in diluted samples. Accurate readings can be produced through molten pour plates at different dilutions of the base sample. It was hypothesised that bacteria would be detectable by this medium wherever present.

Spread plates of discriminatory media allow further counts of Coliforms, yeasts and moulds. Chromocult Coliform Agar distinguishes E. coli from other Coliforms through enzyme sensitive chromogenic agents (Frampton, Restaino, & Blaszko, 1988). E. coli will present with dark-blue colonies, distinct from other pink Coliforms and yellow non-Coliforms. Contamination with yeasts and moulds can be determined through Potato Dextrose Agar, a medium of potato extract and glucose. If present in food samples, lawns of yeast, fungus and mould will grow from this medium.

Pathogenic coagulase positive Staphylococcus can be identified using Baird-Parker Agar (Baird-Parker, 1962). A presumptive test of coagulase positive S. aureus is lecithinase production (Matos, Harmon, & Langlois, 1995). This hydrolyses egg lecithin in the agar resulting in opaque halos. S. aureus presence can be corroborated using high-sodium Mannitol Salt Agar (Chapman, 1945). A pH sensitive phenol red additive identifies pathogenic S. aureus through mannitol fermentation.

Streak plates of pre-enriched broth culture allow confirmation of Salmonella or Shigella. Hektoen Enteric Agar includes peptone, lactose, salicin and sucrose to support a range of intestinal bacteria (King & Metzger, 1968). Coliforms appear pink and inclusion of bile salts surrounds colonies with precipitate. Shigella presents with green convex colonies, and Salmonella with green-blue. XLD Agar distinguishes Shigella and Enterobacteriaceae through xylose fermentation (Taylor, 1965). Enterobacteriaceae ferment sugars into acid, however Salmonella will also decarboxylate the lysine causing black centres.

The aim of this study was to measure colony-forming units in water and food samples for comparison against Australian standards. A further aim was to identify pathogenic Staphylococcus, Salmonella and Shigella in foods.

MATERIALS & METHODS
====

A filtration apparatus with aspirator was used for membrane filtration under pressure. From a 200ml water sample, three cycles of 50ml were passed through three 0.45µm pore membrane filters. Membranes for each cycle were placed on Plate Count, Endo and KF Streptococcus Agar plates. After incubation at 37°C for 48 hours plates were retrieved and colonies counted.

Food samples included 10g of salami, vegetables, raw milk, chicken mince, cream cake and soft cheese. Each was homogenised with 90ml sterile peptone water in a stomacher circulator to produce 10-1 dilution base solutions. These were further diluted with peptone water for 10-2 and 10-3 solutions for pour plates. Three sterile petri dishes were each inoculated with 1ml of one dilution and covered by molten deeps of Plate Count Agar.

Plates of Chromocult Coliform, Potato Dextrose, Baird-Parker and Mannitol Salt Agar were spread inoculated with 0.1ml of the 10-1 base solutions. The 10-1 base solutions were then incubated at 37°C for 24 hours to produce a pre-enriched broth. Hektoen and XLD agar were inoculated with this broth using bunsen burner sterilsed loop streaking.

All plated were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours then retrieved for colony counts and assessment.

RESULTS
====

Total colony counts were retrieved from Plate Count Agar, Coliform counts from Endo Agar and Enterococci counts from KF Streptococcus Agar. Results were summarised in Table 1.

Table 1. Water sample colony counts

||Total|Coliform|Enterococci|
|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Number of colonies|20|49|193|
|Volume of water sampled|50|50|50|
|Viable count|0.4cfu/ml|98 cfu/100ml|cfu/100ml|

Australian Guidelines for Microbiological Quality of Water require drinking water to contain less than 100 cfu/ml. This means that total counts in the sample where beneath the upper limit set for human consumption. However, guidelines state that Coliform and Enterococci counts must be less than 1 cfu/100ml. Counts within this sample exceed both standards and indicate that this water sample was contaminated and is unsafe for drinking.

Of the food samples, detailed analysis was carried out on chicken mince. The first assessment was total colony counts and results were tabulated below in Table 2.

Table 2. Chicken mince sample colony counts by dilution

||10⁻¹ dilution|10⁻² dilution|10⁻³ dilution|
|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Number of colonies|>300|>300|250|


Colony counts are sensitive between 30 and 300 colonies, leaving only the 10-3 dilution for further analysis. The number of cfu per gram would be 250x103x1, or 2.5x105 cfu/g in the original sample. According to Australian Food Standards AS5013 this chicken mince exceeds the 100 cfu/g limit and is not safe for consumption.

Chromocult Coliform Agar presented with abundant growth of dark-blue E. coli, other pink Coliforms and yellow non-Coliforms. Colony counts exceeded 300 cfu/g each for Coliforms and non-Coliforms. E. coli counts were 50, indicating 5x103 cfu/g in the original sample.

Potato Dextrose Agar showed some minor growth not exceeding 10 colonies. This showed low yeast, mould and fungus contamination in chicken mince relative to high bacterial concentrations.

Pathogenic coagulase positive Staphylococcus was tested with two spread plate mediums. The first medium, Baird-Parker Agar, showed less than 10 colonies and these lacked opaque haloes. The second, Mannitol Salt Agar, also had less than 10 colonies and these were faintly yellow. This indicated that the chicken mince had very little or low pathogenic Staphylococcus.

The presence of Salmonella and Shigella was tested with two streaked plates. Hektoen Enteric Agar was overgrown with thick pink growth with a caked layer of precipitate bile salts. However, the final streak showed blue raise colonies, a positive result for Salmonella. XLD Agar was yellow from xylose fermentation, lacking any red colonies that might be specific to Shigella. Shigella may have been present yet concealed by many other bacteria within the medium (i.e. Escherichia).

A similar analysis as was carried out for chicken mince was performed on the other food samples. Results are shown below in Table 3.

Table 3. Food sample combined analysis

|Total Colony Count PCA|>300|1.22x10³|6.4x10³|>300|0|1.8x10⁵|

The highest counts for E. coli and total bacteria were seen in the sample of raw chicken mince. Along with milk it contained very little pathogenic Staphylococcus, instead being positive for Salmonella. In contrast, high sodium foods salami and cheese had zero E. coli and non-Coliforms, with high cfu/g for Staphylococcus.

Cream cake had the least amount of bacteria. This would be the only food sample safe for consumption, were it not for the positive result for Shigella. All food samples had low or no concentration of yeasts, fungus and moulds.

DISCUSSION
====

This paper aimed to measure and assess water and food samples for bacterial content. Results were positive for some bacteria in water samples and in all food samples.

The bacteria groups of Coliform and Enterococci are indicators of water contamination. Safety for consumption can be measured by comparing cfu per gram to Australian standards. A filtration apparatus was used to inoculate membrane filters for incubation in Plate Count, Endo and KF Streptococcus Agar (Kenner, Clark, & Kabler, 1961). Plate Count Agar showed total cfu exceeding safe limits. A Endo plate with red colonies and base indicated the presence of lactose-fermenting Coliforms (e.g. E. coli and non-E. coli). Finally, the KF Streptococcus plate showed likely presence of pathogenic Staphylococcus. This meant this water would not be safe for consumption, containing high total counts of bacteria, some pathogenic.

Foodborne infections can occur at lower bacterial concentrations than water (Madigan et al., 2010, p. 1039). Samples of salami, vegetables, raw milk, chicken mince, cream cake and soft cheese were assessed. Molten pour plates of Plate Count Agar, with different sample dilutions, showed cfu in excess of guidelines for all except cream cake.

Chromocult Coliform Agar contributed to this analysis by distinguishing E. coli from Coliforms and non-Coliforms. Via enzyme sensitive chromogenic agents it exposed E. coli with dark-blue colonies, distinct from pink Coliforms and yellow non-Coliforms. E. coli produces ß-glucuronidase, cleaving the X-Glu chromogen and colouring colonies dark-blue. The remaining Coliforms cleave Rose-Gal with ß-galactosidase, returning pink, and non-Coliforms return yellow. From such results, the highest concentration of E. coli was found in chicken and raw milk, two common sources of outbreaks.

The purpose of Potato Dextrose Agar was assessment of yeast, moulds and fungus. Consisting of potato extract and glucose, this simple medium will encourage lawns of growth whenever these are present. Counts were low or zero for all foods. This may be due to samples being immature and cheese samples being taken from the centre not the moulded rind.

Baird-Parker Agar (Baird-Parker, 1962) and Mannitol Salt Agar (Chapman, 1945) were used to measure pathogenic coagulase positive Staphylococcus. Bacteria such as S. aureus produce lecithinase that will hydrolyse the egg lecithin in the BPA (Matos, Harmon, & Langlois, 1995). This result was corroborated by yellowing of the MSA plates for these foods. Only pathogenic S. aureus ferments mannitol to acid, causing the pH sensitive phenol red additive to yellow. These characteristics were only observed in salami and cheese samples.

One relationship observed was that two foods, salami and soft cheese, had no E. coli or non-Coliforms. These were also the foods positive for pathogenic coagulase positive Staphylococcus. One explanation for this phenomena is the high in sodium concentration of preserved meats and cheese. Sodium inhibits E. coli and non-Coliforms growth, while S. aureus can survive in high-sodium environments.

Streak plates of Hektoen Enteric and XLD Agar provided a final test for Salmonella or Shigella presence. The combination of proteins and sugars allows Hektoen to support most intestinal bacteria (King & Metzger, 1968). Shigella presents with green convex colonies, and Salmonella with blue, both lacking any bile salt precipitate. XLD Agar allows Shigella to be separated from other bacteria through the absence of xylose fermentation (Taylor, 1965). It provides a further test for Salmonella, which decarboxylates lysine such that colonies have black centres. Enterobacteriaceae will both ferment sugars into acid and fail to blacken from lysine decarboxylation.

As with E. coli, Salmonellae were in both found in both chicken and raw milk, two common sources of outbreaks. Shigella was identified in cheese, and it was the only bacteria found in cream cake. It is sufficiently pathogenic that any amount is considered unsafe. The cream cake sample would otherwise have met food standards.

Future research may record and track colony forming units of contaminated samples at different ages and maturities. This will allow time series analysis predicting growth across measured intervals to facilitate outbreak management. Also, research may determine why only Shigella presented in cream cake, and whether this food is well-suited for the genus.
