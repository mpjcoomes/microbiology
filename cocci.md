ABSTRACT
====
This study investigated the response of bacteria from Enterococcus, Moraxella, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus genus in different agar media. Stock species were compared with samples from the nasal carriage, dermis, throat and teeth of two Australian students. Cell morphology, optochin sensitivity, haemolysis, coagulase and acid production were assessed. Results from stock species corroborated prior research and responses of human samples suggested the presence of Streptococcus in the mouth and S. aureus in the upper respiratory system and dermis. Future research may further isolate bacterial species in human samples by using different agar mediums, find the optimal non-mannitol carbohydrate source for S. epidermidis, and catalog the behaviour of Streptococcus in sucrose rich environments.

INTRODUCTION
====

The Enterococcus (i.e. E. faecalis, E. faecalis var. zymogenes), Staphylococcus (i.e. S. aureus, S. epidermidis) and Streptococcus (i.e. S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. pneumoniae) Gram positive genus of coccus, and the Moraxella (i.e. M. catarrhalis) Gram negative, are common in the literature and human environment. Madigan et al. (2010, p789) summarises that the normal microflora of humans can include these bacteria. The gastrointestinal tract contains Enterococcus, S. epidermidis can survive on the skin, S. aureus in acne (p518) and nasal carriage (Grothe et al., 2016), while the mouth and upper respiratory system may contain S. mitis (p791) and S. salivarius (Carlsson et al., 1970).

The two Staphylococcus can be differentiated in Baird-Parker Agar (BPA; Baird-Parker, 1962). S. aureus grows grey to black glossy convex domes, while S. epidermidis blackens and growth is inhibited. Further, S. aureus is coagulase-positive, and a presumptive test of coagulase status is lecithinase production (Matos, Harmon, & Langlois, 1995). BPA includes egg lecithin from an egg yolk emulsion. Lecithinase producing bacteria will consequently have opaque halos as the enzyme hydrolyses lecithin phospholipids from the yolk.

These characterics of Staphylococcus can be corroborated using Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA; Chapman, 1945). The high sodium content controls likely bacteria genus to Staphylococcus. MSA adds to BPA by assessing mannitol fermentation. This is another presumptive coagulase test as negative S. epidermidis cannot utilise mannitol, while positive S. aureus ferments it to lactic acid. The acid lowers the pH of the plate, turning the phenol red additive yellow. S. epidermidis may grow small red colonies despite the lack of mannitol utilisation (Namvar et al., 2014).

In terms of Streptococcus and Enterococcus, haemolysis and optochin sensitivity can be assessed using Horse Blood Agar (HBA). Studied Streptococcus are all α-haemolytic, however S. pneumoniae can be distinguished by a sensitivity to optochin (Chandler et al., 2000). Both Enterococcus are optochin resistant, as per S. mitis and S. salivarius, yet can be differentiated using haemolysis. E. faecalis is γ-haemolytic, while E. faecalis var. zymogenes produces of a β-haemolytic bacteriocin agent that results in complete lysis of red blood cells (Brock & Davie, 1963; Brock, Peacher, & Pierson, 1963).

KF Streptococcus Agar (KFA; Kenner, Clark, & Kabler, 1961) adds to this analysis as S. pneumoniae growth is inhibited while most Enterococcus and S. mitis produce black and red colonies respectively. Similar to MSA, KFA includes a colour sensitive additive that can signal a reduction in pH. Lactic acid production from maltose fermentation turns the bromocresol purple in the medium from a deep blue to yellow for E. faecalis, E. faecalis var. zymogenes (Kenner, Clark, & Kabler, 1961), and S. mitis (Mashimo et al., 1985). The addition of sodium azide controls Gram negative bacteria (Lichstein & Soule, 1944).

The final media had a Sucrose Gelatin Agar (SGA) base, suitable for mouth-born bacteria including S. mutans associated with tooth decay (Staat, 1976). S. salivarius in particular may utilise the sucrose to produce a biofilm capsule and gummy extracellular leven polysaccharide, resulting in a distinct water droplet appearance (Niven, Smiley, & Sherman, 1941). The addition of sodium azide biocide (SGA-NaN3) restricts the culture to Gram positive bacteria.

This study aimed to identify expected reactions from species of Enterococcus, Moraxella, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacteria. It also aimed to investigate unidentified potential bacteria from the nasal carriage, dermis, throat and teeth.

It was hypothesised that S. aureus would grow and halo in BPA and S. epidermidis would not. Similar results would present in MSA for stock cultures, while human samples from the nasal carriage and dermis would indicate the presence of S. aureus. For HFA, some α-haemolytic bacteria will grow from throat samples, only S. pneumoniae growth would be impaired by optochin, and only E. faecalis var. zymogenes would caused complete lysis. For KFA, growth and acid production would be observed for all but S. pneumoniae. Finally for SGA, S. salivarius would produce an extracellular leven product and a Streptococcus bacteria would present in the sodium azide variant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
====
Stock bacterial cultures included E. faecalis, E. faecalis var. zymogenes, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae and S. salivarius. Human samples were sourced from Australian university students free of serious illness (e.g. septicemia, pneumonia). Inoculant was collected from the throat and nasal carriage using sterile cotton swabs, from the teeth using a wooden toothpick, and from dermis via direct finger contact.

Media included two BPA, MSA and KFA each, four HBA, one SGA and one SGA-NaN3. Plates were inoculated with stock cultures or human samples using bunsen burner sterilsed loop streaking.

The two BPA and two MSA plates received the same protocol. All plates were halved. One of each was streaked with S. aureus in the first half (BPA-1a, MSA-1a) and S. epidermidis in the second (BPA-1b, MSA-1b). Half plates of each were streaked with nasal carriage inoculant from a cotton swab (BPA-2a, MSA-2a) and direct finger contact (BPA-2b, MSA-2b).

One HBA plate was streaked with throat inoculant pressed to the agar surface from the cotton swab (HBA-1). HBA-2 was streaked with stock S. pneumoniae. Half plates were streaked with S. salivarius (HBA-3a), S. mitis (HBA-3b), E. faecalis (HBA-4a) and E. faecalis var. zymogenes (HBA-4b). Optochin discs were placed in streaks of all HBA plates other than the throat sample (HBA-2 to 4).

KFA plates were streaked with S. pneumoniae (KFA-1a), S. mitis (KFA-1b), E. faecalis (KFA-2a) and E. faecalis var. zymogenes (KFA-2b). SGA was streaked with S. salivarius and SGA-NaN3 with tooth matter.

Media were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. Post-incubation plates and stock cultures were analysed for Gram stain status, lecithinase, haemolysis, optochin sensitivity and acid production.

RESULTS
====
Gram stain showed M. catarrhalis to be negative diplococcus. All remaining stock cultures and samples were Gram-positive.

Experimental plates were analysed and results are shown in Table 1.

DISCUSSION
====

M. catarrhalis produce a negative Gram stain. Unlike Gram positive bacteria, this species lacks lattices of peptidoglycan in the cell wall. When crystal violet is fixed into complexes via iodine, the cell wall is too thin for the dark stain to persist, resulting in a pink counterstain.

The BPA result supported prior research and first hypothesis in promoting S. aureus growth over S. epidermidis (Baird-Parker, 1962). S. aureus was further identified by the haloing around growths, representing a presumptive test for coagulase-positive bacteria (Matos, Harmon, & Langlois, 1995). This was caused by the S. aureus production of lecithinase. This enzyme hydrolyses the egg lecithin in BPA, causing the halos observed around the colonies.

Similar markers suggested the presence of S. aureus in the nasal carriage and dermal samples. The glossy, black, convex domes with haloing resembled stock cultures of S. aureus and the literature expectation. This does not confirm the species however, as other coagulase positive bacteria and species variants present this way in BPA.

Like BPA, MSA samples supported hypotheses and replicated prior research via manifest S. aureus growth and no change in S. epidermidis (Chapman, 1945). MSA plates refined BPA results in terms of being a more restrictive nutritional medium. The high sodium of MSA in contrast to BPA restricts the range of bacteria to mostly Staphylococcus. Further, the available carbohydrate in this media is mannitol. This meant that only those bacteria capable of utilising this as an energy source will grow, indicated by lactic acid production. The pH sensitive additive phenol red turned yellow in areas where the sugar was utilised. S. aureus utilised the mannitol while S. epidermidis lacked this energy pathway (Namvar et al., 2014).

Results from BPA and MSA plates suggested that the bacterial samples from the nasal carriage and dermis may have been S. aureus. The high sodium content and restriction to mannitol further restricted MSA results to S. aureus. This is a common bacteria in the upper respiratory system (Grothe et al., 2016) and could be transferred to dermis sample (i.e. to fingers) from rhinotillexis and contact with facial acne (Madigan et al., p518.). S. epidermidis may have been present in these human samples as well. However, as the BPA and MSA mediums do not support it, only the S. aureus species would have grown and been observed in results.

Bacterial growth on all HBA plates was expected and observed, as this medium meets the nutritional requirements of many bacteria. As hypothesised S. pneumoniae was optochin sensitive and this was the main difference in the three α-haemolytic Streptococcus. The throat sample was also α-haemolytic, supporting prior research that non-pathogenic bacteria are common microflora in the human upper respiratory system (Madigan et al., p518.).

Neither Enterococcus species was optochin sensitive. The two bacteria were easily separated by opposing haemolytic profiles. Result supported prior research in that E. faecalis was γ-haemolytic with no apparent lysis to the blood medium. In contrast, the zymogenes subspecies demonstrated near complete lysis and plate clearing. This was likely due to the β-haemolytic bacteriocin agent produced by that Enterococcus variant (Brock & Davie, 1963; Brock, Peacher, & Pierson, 1963).

The growth of all but S. pneumoniae in the KFA was hypothesised and supported prior research (Kenner, Clark, & Kabler, 1961; Kenner, Clark, & Kabler, 1961). The S. mitis growth shown in the literature was supported in kind, not in degree. Only moderate growth and weak acid production was indicated (Mashimo et al., 1985). The results of this research showed S. mitis growth extending into the S. pneumoniae plate section. This was identified by the pH sensitive additive bromocresol purple turning yellow from maltose fermentation in all but the deepest main streak of S. pneumoniae.

Finally for the SGA mediums, as hypothesised S. salivarius produced large convex water droplet like growths. This was caused by the sucrose utilisation of this species towards extracellular leven polysaccharides (Niven, Smiley, & Sherman, 1941). The absence of these large droplets in the sodium azide variant (SGA-NaN3) reduced the likelihood that the tooth sample was also S. salivarius. Nevertheless, the smaller droplet structure could be from some mouth-born Gram positive bacteria, such as S. mutans or S. mitis, as the azide biocide should only control Gram negative bacteria.

Future research could isolate other bacteria in the nasal carriage and dermis by exposing samples to media inhibiting S. aureus and promoting S. epidermidis. This could be combined with research identifying the optimal non-mannitol carbohydrate source promoting acid production in S. epidermidis. Finally, the extracellular products of S. salivarius in sucrose are novel, and research may benefit from documenting and grouping species of S. mutans, S. mitis and other Streptococcus on this basis.
