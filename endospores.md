*Endospore Forming Bacteria*
====

ABSTRACT
====

This study investigated endospore forming rod bacteria from the Bacillus (i.e. B. cereus, B. subtilis) and Clostridium (i.e. C. perfringens, C. sporogenes) genera. Species were assessed on colonial morphology, haemolytic phenotype, surface and flagellar motility, sugar fermentation, and the production of α-amylase, catalase, gelatinase and lecithinase enzymes. Most results aligned with hypotheses and literature. The Bacillus were catalase and gelatinase positive. B. cereus and C. perfringens had a β-haemolytic phenotype, B. subtilis and C. sporogenes were α-haemolytic. B. subtilis hydrolysed starch and fermented mannitol, while B. cereus was lecithinase positive without mannitol fermentation. C. sporogenes was a saccharolytic lactose fermenter and C. perfringens was proteolytic. Motility was not observed in B. cereus and convex C. perfringens colonies did not present in pour plates. Future research may identify factors impairing B. cereus motility and whether proteolytic bacteria preferentially metabolise certain protein structures as saccharolytic bacteria ferment specific sugars.

INTRODUCTION
====

The Bacillus (i.e. B. cereus, B. subtilis) and Clostridium (i.e. C. perfringens, C. sporogenes) genera have been found in the human gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts (Madigan et al., 2010, p. 789). There are metabolic variations between genera and species. The aim of this research was to observe these in different media and contrast results with the literature.

The Bacillus and Clostridium are Gram positive rods. They form endospores in circumstances of nutrient deficiency. Sporulation is the process whereby a prokaryote embeds a copy of its chromosome in an unreactive layered structure. The original cell wall lyses and releases a dehydrated endospore into the environment. This genetic material from the bacteria can be revived after centuries of dormancy (Reece et al., 2011, pp. 569-570). Combined analysis of Bacillus and Clostridium is meaningful in terms of a general nutrient rich agars, catalase, haemolytic phenotype and motility.

Both genera can be cultured in nutrient-rich agars. A suitable medium is Nutrient Agar (NutA) for Bacillus and Brain Heart Infusion Agar (BHIA; Rosenow, 1919) for Clostridium. 

Catalase is a bacterial virulence factor. It neutralises the hydrogen peroxide output by phagocytes attempting to defend against an invader (Naclerio et al., 1995). The Bacillus are catalase positive and Clostridium are catalase negative (Drobniewski, 1993).

Haemolysis can be assessed using Horse Blood Agar (HBA). B. cereus has been identified as β-haemolytic due to the hemolysin BL exotoxin. Continuous clearing is expected in sheep blood, and an α-haemolytic clearing may occur in horse blood (Beecher & Wong, 1994). Isolates of B. subtilis and C. sporogenes also have mixed phenotypes. Figueroa-López et al. (2016) found that two of five B. subtilis isolates were α-haemolytic and the remaining three were β-haemolytic. C. sporogenes is at least α-haemolytic (Gonzalez et al., 2010). C. perfringens is pathogenic and has been identified as the cause of gas gangrene in humans. It produces multiple extracellular toxins and presents consistently with a full β-haemolytic phenotype (Rood, 1998; Hashiba et al., 2016).

Motility Medium Agar (MotA; Tittsler & Sandholzer, 1936) shows if a species is capable of positive or negative chemotaxis, meaning whether it moves towards nutrients or away from toxins (Reece et al., 2011, p. 570). B. cereus (Senesi et al., 2002), B. subtilis (Gupta & Rao, 2009) and C. sporogenes (Eller, Rogers & Wynne, 1967) possess flagellum, the mechanical means by which most prokaryotes achieve locomotion. C. perfringens lacks flagellum and is classified as non-motile in liquid. However, it can align filaments in such a way as to be motile across surfaces (Liu et al., 2014). Motility may not be observed due to minor variations in strain and agar formula (Senesi et al., 2002).

Genera-specific analyses are possible. Tests meaningful to Bacillus include selective agar, starch hydrolysis, mannitol fermentation and gelatinase. Further analysis of Clostridium can involve pour plates, thioglycollate broth, lactose fermentation and protein breakdown.

The Bacillus Cereus Selective Agar (BCSA; Holbrook & Anderson, 1980) contains mannitol, egg yolk lecithin and a pH sensitive additive bromothymol blue. B. cereus produces lecithinase that hydrolyses lecithin, precipitating the yolk in irregular crests with haloing around colonies (Hoult & Tuxford, 1991). In the absence of mannitol fermentation the cleared portions of agar adopt the vivid colour of bromothymol blue. In contrast, B. subtilis ferments mannitol (Mossel, Koopman & Jongerius, 1967) and lacks lecithinase (Bhat et al., 2013), resulting in yellowing around colonies and a different morphology.

The Bacillus can be contrasted using Starch Agar (StaA; Vedder, 1915) as the species differ in the extent they metabolise complex sugars (Madigan et al., 2010, p. 522). B. subtilis can produce α-amylase to hydrolyse starch. It is used industrially to break down indigestible saccharides from soybeans so they become fit for humans consumption (Shrestha, Dahal & Ndungutse, 2010). B. cereus lacks this amylase, so when iodine is flooded into plates after incubation, it forms dark complexes with the intact starch sugars.

Similar analyses are possible in terms of less complex sugar fermentation using Mannitol Peptone Waters (MPW). B. subtilis ferments a diverse range of sugars, including glucose, fructose, sucrose and many simpler breakdown products (Sarkar & Tamang, 1995). In contrast, B. cereus cannot ferment mannitol. Neither should produce gas. The result is that the blue pH sensitive additive remains blue for B. cereus, and turns yellow for B. subtilis (Heravi & Altenbuchner, 2014). 

Gelatin assesses production of the gelatinase enzyme. Positive Bacillus species hydrolyse the gelatin protein converting the fixed medium into liquid (i.e. liquefaction). Both B. cereus and B. subtilis produce gelatinase (Mazotto et al., 2011).

The first selective media for the Clostridium bacteria is Perfringens Agar (PFA; Handford, 1974). A pour plate protocol involves inoculating the bacteria onto a sterile petri dish then adding molten agar. Of the two species only C. perfringens presents with convex black domes.

Thioglycollate broth (Brewer, 1940) can determine the aerotolerance and motility of Clostridium. While Bacillus may grow in the presence or absence of oxygen (i.e. aerobic or facultatively anaerobic), Clostridium require a low oxygen environment (i.e. obligate anaerobe). The motile C. sporogenes moves away from the surface and grows through the broth at optimal oxygen concentrations. In contrast, the surface motile C. perfringens can only grow deep within the viscous broth at the point of inoculation (Stieglmeier et al., 2009).

The final Clostridium comparison is metabolism, using litmus milk, Lactose Peptone Water (LPW) and cooked meat. Bacteria can be saccharolytic and ferment sugars, proteolytic and break down proteins, or both (Paredes, Alsaker & Papoutsakis, 2005). C. perfringens is saccharolytic and C. sporogenes is proteolytic (Stickland, 1934; Poehlein et al., 2015; Madigan et al., 2010, p. 523). Litmus milk includes both lactose sugar and casein protein. The saccharolytic C. perfringens ferments lactose to acid, yellowing the litmus yet leaving the casein to clot. In contrast, the proteolytic C. sporogenes peptonises the casein without fermenting the lactose. The same phenomena can be observed in isolation with LPW and cooked meat. Only C. perfringens will ferment the lactose in LPW (Al-Hinai, Jones & Papoutsakis, 2015) and only C. sporogenes will visibly break down cooked meat.

This study aimed to identify reactions from species of Bacillus and Clostridium bacteria in general mediums, then further that analysis with tests meaningful to each genera. It was hypothesised that the Bacillus will be catalase positive and the Clostridium catalase negative. B. cereus and C. perfringens will have β-haemolytic phenotypes and B. subtilis and C. sporogenes will be α-haemolytic. All species will be motile except for C. perfringens that will be limited to surface motility. Both Bacillus will liquefy gelatin, however only B. subtilis will digest starch or ferment mannitol, and only B. cereus will produce lecithinase. C. perfringens will produce black convex domes on pour plates and ferment lactose, while C. sporogenes will metabolise proteins and not sugars.

MATERIALS & METHODS
====

Stock cultures included B. cereus, B. subtilis, C. perfringens and C. sporogenes. Laboratory materials and equipment were required for catalase testing, Gram and spore staining (e.g. hydrogen peroxide, iodine, malachite green, acetone).

Petri media included two each of Horse Blood Agar (HBA), Motility Medium Agar (MotA), Nutrient Agar (NutA), Brain Heart Infusion Agar (BHIA), Bacillus Cereus Selective Agar (BCSA), Perfringens Agar (PFA), and one Starch Agar (StaA).

The PFA pour plates were each inoculated with 1ml of 106 dilutions of one Clostridium species. Equivalent colony-forming units per milliliter were 33 x 106, over which 45°C molten PFA was poured. One genera was assigned to each of the two MotA plates and each half was inoculated with 0.5 mL of stock culture broth. One Bacillus species was assigned to each half of the StaA plate and inoculated with a 1ml line of culture broth.

Remaining plates were inoculated with stock cultures using bunsen burner sterilsed loop streaking. The two HBA plates were halved and one of four species streaked onto each half. A Bacillus species was streaked onto each NutA and BCSA plate, and a Clostridium species to each BHIA plate.

Other media includes two thioglycollate broth, gelatin deeps, Mannitol Peptone Waters (MPW), Lactose Peptone Waters (LPW), litmus milks and cooked meat medium tubes. Thioglycollate broth was inoculated by stabbing loops of inoculum to the base of each and  0.5 mL of broth culture was pipetted into each remaining media.

Samples were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. Litmus milks and peptone waters were incubated in anaerobic jars. Cooked meat medium and thioglycollate broths were left in a conventional incubator.

RESULTS
====

Preliminary results included cell morphology and catalase testing. Gram and spore stains under microscope showed that all bacteria were Gram-positive, endospore forming rods. Only the two Bacillus were catalase positive.

Growth was evident for all NutA and BHIA plates. In NutA, there were no distinctive differences between B. cereus and B. subtilis. Each presented with punctiform cream-coloured colonies. These were flat in elevation with undulated margins. There were greater differences between BHIA plates, where C. sporogenes had circular, convex colonies with even margins and C. perfringens was filamentous and flat to the agar.

In HBA, B. cereus presented with β-haemolysis. There was an abundance of brown colonies, undulated and raised throughout the half-plate, with a ‘sandy’ or ‘granular’ precipitate at margins. B. subtilis had sufficient clearing for an α-haemolytic phenotype and it appeared translucent and mucoid. C. sporogenes also had α-haemolytic clearing, this time with filamentous flat white colonies across the agar surface. C. perfringens had translucent colonies similar to B. subtilis, only with full β-haemolytic clearing of the half-plate.

In the MotA plates, B. cereus grew a thick, raised, irregular colony expanding from the inoculation site. However, it maintained clear fixed margins, with no evident motility outside the main colony or across the agar surface. In contrast, B. subtilis was the most motile bacteria, covering the entire half-plate with a thin cloudy layer of growth. For the Clostridium, both presented with some motility, with flat growth expanding from inoculation sites in curled margins.

In the BCSA plates, B. cereus cleared the egg yolk emulsion and presented as bright blue. The yolk precipitated into undulate crests with clear halos around colony margins. B. subtilis lacked precipitate, exhibiting convex circular colonies and undulate margins. The plate agar was yellow and green around colonies from acid production.

When the StaA plate was flooded with iodine a clear streak of amber formed across the B. subtilis inoculation site. The B. cereus site formed a dark purple line. The two PFA pour plates of Clostridium were indistinguishable, both presenting with clear punctiform even margined colonies. Results for petri plated media were summarised below in Table 1.

Remaining experimental media were bottles, deeps and bijoux of solution. Both Bacillus showed full liquefaction of the gelatin deeps. Some bacteria grew in the C. perfringens inoculation site of thioglycollate broth, while foggy particles of C. sporogenes growth were apparent throughout the tube. Of the peptone waters, B. subtilis and C. perfringens turned yellow with gas production for C. perfringens, while B. cereus and C. sporogenes remained blue without gas.

The C. perfringens litmus milk cultured into a pink cheese-like clot. For C. sporogenes, the top of the litmus milk tube was blue, however the remainder had been cleared of the particulate matter (i.e. of milk proteins). The quantity of meat in the C. sporogenes tube was visibly lower than the C. perfringens tube, which was unchanged. These results were summarised below in Table 2.

DISCUSSION
====

The Bacillus and Clostridium were assessed for morphology, haemolysis, motility, sugar fermentation, catalase, gelatinase and lecithinase. These bacteria were catalase positive, Gram positive and endospore forming.

Spore staining was necessary to confirm the presence of endospores, as the outer layer lacks lattices of peptidoglycan in the cell wall. When crystal violet is fixed into complexes via iodine, as per Gram stain protocol, the cell wall will not stain.

Positive catalase tests for Bacillus indicated the production of catalase. Bacillus may use this enzyme to neutralise hydrogen peroxide output by other cells (Drobniewski, 1993; Naclerio et al., 1995).

Complete lysis of cells by B. cereus and C. perfringens, even in horse blood (Beecher & Wong, 1994), showed these bacteria to be pathogenic. It supported the hypothesis of β-haemolytic phenotypes (Rood, 1998). B. subtilis and C. sporogenes were α-haemolytic, in support of the current mixed literature (Figueroa-López et al., 2016; Gonzalez et al., 2010).

Motility plate and thioglycollate broth results aligned with most hypotheses and prior research. Clostridium were anaerobic and did not grow in the presence of oxygen. C. sporogenes had flagellar motility, exhibiting negative chemotaxis to low-oxygen sections of broth. In contrast, C. perfringens had surface motile only, restricting growth to the point of inoculation in broths when outside of an anaerobic jar (Stieglmeier et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2014). B. cereus was not motile as hypothesised. Despite growth from the inoculation site the bacteria did not spread across the medium. The literature notes that motility is vulnerable to strain mutation and minor variations in agar (Senesi et al., 2002).

The absence of black domes in PFA of C. perfringens was not expected (Handford, 1974). An explanation was that maturation time exceeded the window in which these appear.

The literature indicated that B. cereus and B. subtilis produce gelatinase (Mazotto et al., 2011). This enzyme hydrolyses gelatin proteins. Breakdown of these proteins reverts the fixed medium into liquid. Both Bacillus showed full liquefaction of gelatin as hypothesised.

When starch plates were flooded with iodine only B. subtilis had degraded the complex carbohydrate. This corroborated its industrial use in metabolising indigestible saccharides for human consumption (Shrestha, Dahal & Ndungutse, 2010; Vedder, 1915). B. cereus did not hydrolyses starch into simpler sugars as it does not produce the α-amylase enzyme.

The MPW and BCSA results supported the hypothesis that B. subtilis would ferment mannitol (Mossel, Koopman & Jongerius, 1967). The peptone water changed from blue to yellow as the mannitol fermentation produced acid and lowered the pH (Heravi & Altenbuchner, 2014). This was corroborated by yellowing of mannitol-rich and pH sensitive BCSA for B. subtilis. The colonial morphology in BCSA also supported the hypothesis that B. cereus would produce lecithinase (Hoult & Tuxford, 1991). Lecithinase producing bacteria clear the egg yolk from the plate and precipitate it as irregular crests with haloing. In the absence of mannitol fermentation the plate adopts a vivid bromothymol blue colouring that was observed.

It was hypothesised that C. perfringens would ferment sugars and C. sporogenes would hydrolyse proteins (i.e. saccharolytic, proteolytic). A suitable test for both bacteria was litmus milk. According to prior research C. perfringens ferments lactose, a sugar in milk, producing acid that changes the litmus from blue to pink (Al-Hinai, Jones & Papoutsakis, 2015). However, it cannot peptonise milk casein proteins, leaving soft clots. The proteolytic C. sporogenes in contrast metabolises the proteins, without fermenting lactose, resulting in a clear or cloudy blue solution. LPW and cooked meat mediums confirm these relationships in isolation; only C. perfringens ferments the lactose into acid, only C. sporogenes visibly degrades the animal proteins (Stickland, 1934; Poehlein et al., 2015).

Future research may investigate what mutation, agar concentration, environment (e.g. aerobic, anaerobic) causes B. cereus to present with abundant yet non-motile growth. Another area for research is whether proteolytic bacteria preferentially hydrolyse specific proteins and amino acids, as per saccharolytic bacteria fermenting specific sugars.
