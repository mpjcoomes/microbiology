*Enterobacteriaceae & Non-Enteric Gram Negative Bacilli*
====

ABSTRACT
====

This study investigated gram-negative facultative anaerobes from the Enterobacteriaceae family and Miscellaneous Gram-negative Bacilli (MGNB) classification. Motility was determined, then Escherichia coli and Vibrio parahaemolyticus separated for oxidase, miniaturised system, nitrate reduction and ONPG testing. This Vibrio was identified as an oxidase and nitrate positive, facultatively anaerobic glucose fermenter. Enterobacteriaceae were assessed on Methyl Red, Voges-Proskauer and Indole tests, and sugar fermentation in a range of mediums. Most were lactose or glucose fermenters, E. coli producing mixed acids and Klebsiella pneumoniae using butanediol fermentation. Future research may investigate distinctive Salmonella colonial morphology in XLD agar and add subspecies variation to miniaturised systems.

INTRODUCTION
====

This paper aimed to explore the characteristics of Enterobacteriaceae and Miscellaneous Gram-negative Bacilli (MGNB) in a range of genus appropriate tests. Species included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, Alcaligenes faecalis and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The E. coli and V. parahaemolyticus species were selected for Gram-staining, catalase, oxidase and microsystem testing. The MGNB were assessed for motility and Enterobacteriaceae for sugar fermentation and other tests (e.g. Indole).

Gram-staining, catalase, oxidase, and miniaturised system testing was carried out on E. Coli and V. parahaemolyticus. It was hypothesised that both species would be Gram-negative and catalase positive. Catalase neutralises hydrogen peroxide. It is a virulence factor output by these bacteria to disable phagocytes defending against invaders (Naclerio et al., 1995)

E. Coli and V. parahaemolyticus differ in production of the cytochrome oxidase enzyme. Only the Vibrio species were hypothesised to be oxidase positive, determined using oxidase sticks (Gaby & Hadley, 1957). Further study on the metabolism of V. parahaemolyticus can be done using the Oxidation-Fermentation (O-F) test. This test uses two glucose-rich tubes of agar, one sealed with oil, along with a pH sensitive bromothymol blue additive. Acid production in each tube shows whether the bacteria will oxidise or ferment glucose in aerobic or anaerobic conditions. As a facultative anaerobe, it was hypothesised that V. parahaemolyticus would be both fermentative and oxidative (Hugh & Leifson, 1953).

Miniaturised systems are a computerised methods of chemically identifying bacteria (Lapage et al., 1973). Microbact 12A/B ID kits were prepared for E. coli and V. parahaemolyticus. It was hypothesised that the database of species characteristics would identify each species. For V. parahaemolyticus, reagents were added to the ONPG well, to assess the hypothesis of positive nitrate reduction.

Motility refers to whether a bacteria may chemotaxis towards nutrients or away from toxins (Reece et al., 2011, p. 570). Flagellum are the mechanical means of locomotion and can be unidirectional polar or multi-directional peritrichous. The type is observed through light microscope examination of live hanging drop samples. It was hypothesised that P. aeruginosa would have polar flagella, A. faecalis peritrichous and C. meningosepticum would be non-motile. Motility Agar (Tittsler & Sandholzer, 1936) allows an incubated test of motility in a growth medium. It was used to assess V. parahaemolyticus which was hypothesised to be motile.

The four Enterobacteriaceae (i.e. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris and S. typhimurium) were separated for several isolated tests. This included sugar fermentation, urease production, and the Methyl Red, Voges-Proskauer and Indole tests.

Sugar fermentation can be assessed with Kligler's Iron Agar. Ten parts lactose to one part glucose, acid from sugar fermentation turns a pH sensitive phenol red additive to yellow. Gaps appear in the agarose from gas production, and an iron salt blackens if hydrogen sulphide is produced (Bailey & Lacy, 1927). It was hypothesised that E. coli and K. pneumoniae would ferment lactose and produce gas. In contrast, P. vulgaris and S. typhimurium will produce hydrogen sulphide, blackening the iron salt throughout each tube. Urea agar complements results from Kligler’s Iron by differentiating hydrogen sulphide producing species. Proteus and Klebsiella genus are mostly urease enzyme positive, while Escherichia and Salmonella are negative (Hugh & Leifson, 1953). Based on this it was hypothesised that only P. vulgaris and K. pneumoniae will test positive in urea agar.

Several small tests are meaningful in identifying Enterobacteriaceae. The Methyl Red and Voges-Proskauer tests involve incubating glucose-phosphate-peptone water broths of bacteria. The phosphate in the broth buffers acid and only mixed acids from glucose fermentation will lower pH. It was hypothesised that E. coli would produce sufficient acids to return a positive red result. The Voges-Proskauer test assesses glucose metabolism through butanediol fermentation that does not produce mixed acids. This metabolic pathways stores chemical energy in acetoin, which is oxidised to diacetyl and turned pink by test reagents. K. pneumoniae was hypothesised to return a positive Voges-Proskauer reaction (Campbell & Roth, 1975). The Indole tests is carried out by incubating bacteria in tryptone water broths. This tests the production of the tryptophanase enzyme by assessing conversion of tryptophan into indole. When Kovac's reagent is added the additive appears as a red indole ring. It was hypothesised that E. coli and P. vulgaris would be indole positive (Li & Young, 2013).

The final comparison of Enterobacteriaceae was in MacConkey agar (MacConkey, 1905), Eosin Methylene Blue agar (Levine, 1918) and XLD agar (Taylor, 1965). MacConkey agar identifies lactose fermentation through red or pink colonies. Based on this, it is expected that non-lactose fermenters P. vulgaris and S. typhimurium will be transparent amber. Lactose fermenters E. coli and K. pneumoniae will be red or pink. Eosin Methylene Blue agar will similarly identify lactose fermentation, except that E. coli will present a metallic green shine. For the XLD plate some growth is hypothesised for all bacteria. However, this medium is selective for S. typhimurium, which has no glucose to ferment and will present as convex black domes. The lactose-sucrose-xylose mix will enable all remaining Enterobacteriaceae to ferment sugars into acid.

MATERIALS & METHODS
====

Stock cultures included E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, S. typhimurium, P. aeruginosa, C. meningosepticum, A. faecalis and V. parahaemolyticus. Laboratory reagents, slides and test strips were required to carry our Gram-staining, catalase and oxidase tests to protocol.

Stock cultures of E. coli and V. parahaemolyticus were added to two McCartney bottles of sterile saline. Within five minutes they were pipetted into two individual Microbact 12A/B kits, followed by mineral oil as per manufacturer guidelines. Microbacts were re-sealed and incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. After incubation reagents were added and kits scored for computerised analysis. Following this reagents were added to the ONPG well of the V. parahaemolyticus Microbact to test nitrate reduction.

Motility was identified using hanging drop tests for P. aeruginosa, A. faecalis and C. meningosepticum. Water droplets of live culture were suspended on microscope slides and observed. V. parahaemolyticus was added to a motility plate for assessment using an incubated medium.

O-F test tubes were stab inoculated with V. parahaemolyticus and one tube was sealed with sterile oil. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris and S. typhimurium were inoculated into individual tubes of Kligler's Iron Agar. These Enterobacteriaceae were streaked onto four Urea agar slants, added to four glucose-phosphate-peptone waters and four tryptone water broths. Post-incubation waters and broths were used for Methyl Red, Voges-Proskauer and Indole tests.

Plate mediums included two each of MacConkey, Eosin Methylene Blue and XLD agar. All were halved, inoculated with the Enterobacteriaceae using bunsen burner sterilsed loop streaking, then incubated at 37°C for 48 hours.

RESULTS
====

Both E. coli and V. parahaemolyticus were pink under Gram-staining and decomposed hydrogen sulphide on exposure. This meant they were Gram-negative and catalase positive. Only V. parahaemolyticus turned oxidase sticks blue, oxidising dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine into indophenol blue. Both O-F tubes turned yellow for V. parahaemolyticus, meaning it was able to oxidase glucose aerobically and ferment it anaerobically.

The miniaturised system Microbact successfully identified E. coli with 54.51% probability. Positive sorbitol fermentation was the first test against recommendation. As most E. coli ferment sorbitol switching this test increased match likelihood. The V. parahaemolyticus Microbact was only 9.32% probability, producing a false positive for Vibrio vulnificus at 76.34%. Tryptophan deaminase was the first test against, for which most Vibrio test negative with the exception of V. vulnificus. Switching this test from positive to negative made V. parahaemolyticus the first match. A subsequent nitrate test showed red after reagents were added to the ONPG well. This meant that V. parahaemolyticus was positive for nitrate reduction.

Hanging drop tests showed polar flagella for P. aeruginosa and peritrichous for A. faecalis. C. meningosepticum lacked flagella and was non-motile. V. parahaemolyticus exhibited motility on the motility plate.

Kligler's Iron Agar tubes where yellow from butt to slant for E. coli and K. pneumoniae. This meant both species fermented lactose and glucose to acid. Fissures were visible in the agar, indicative of gas production. In contrast, P. vulgaris and S. typhimurium tubes were blackened and indistinguishable. The hydrogen sulphide production of these species reduced the iron salt into a black precipitate. P. vulgaris was distinguishable in the complementary Urea agar, as only it and K. pneumoniae turned the medium red. This showed both as positive of urease enzyme while E. coli and S. typhimurium were negative.

In smaller tests, E. coli was positive on the Methyl Red test and K. pneumoniae on the Voges-Proskauer test. Both E. coli and P. vulgaris exhibited indole rings. Table 1 below summarised these Enterobacteriaceae results.

In MacConkey agar plate P. vulgaris and S. typhimurium were transparent amber. This showed that they do not ferment lactose or grow strongly in this medium. In contrast, both lactose fermenters E. coli and K. pneumoniae grew. They presented distinct morphologies, with E. coli being flat, red and dry, and K. pneumoniae raise, pink and mucoid. For the Eosin Methylene Blue agar plate K. pneumoniae was again raised, pink and mucoid. E. coli presented as flat, however it adopted a green metallic shine. S. typhimurium has small pink colonies and was slightly more visible in this medium than P. vulgaris. Finally, S. typhimurium was the significant bacteria in the last XLD plates. Of all samples it alone presented with black convex domes, and an absence of sugar fermentation.

DISCUSSION
====

This paper studied Enterobacteriaceae and MGNB in terms of motility, sugar fermentation and several small tests (e.g. Methyl red). Detailed analyses were done on E. coli and V. parahaemolyticus including Gram-stain, catalase, oxidase and miniaturised kits.

E. coli and V. parahaemolyticus were confirmed as Gram-negative. These Enterobacteriaceae and MGNB species lack lattices of cell wall peptidoglycan. When crystal violet is fixed into complexes via iodine, the cell wall is too thin for the dark stain to persist, resulting in a pink counterstain. When hydrogen sulphide was applied, both species produced foaming, a positive result for the catalase test. It indicated the production of the catalase enzyme that reduces the hydrogen sulphide to water and oxygen. Bacteria use this to neutralise hydrogen peroxide output by immune cells and is a well-known virulence factor (Naclerio et al., 1995).

E. coli and V. parahaemolyticus differed in terms of the oxidase test. Only V. parahaemolyticus tested positive for production of the cytochrome oxidase enzyme via oxidase sticks (Gaby & Hadley, 1957). The production of this enzyme means that V. parahaemolyticus is able to use oxygen for energy production. This contrast may be explained by most Vibrio being non-enteric, unlike the Enterobacteriaceae.

It was hypothesised that V. parahaemolyticus, a facultative anaerobe, would be both fermentative and oxidative in O-F tests (Hugh & Leifson, 1953). Both test tubes turned yellow, meaning acid was fermented from glucose in either anaerobic and aerobic condition. This supported prior research that this Vibrio was both fermentative and oxidative.

Microsystem analysis was effective in confirming E. coli. Further, the first 'test against' for sorbitol fermentation was the correct recommendation. This approach was less effective for V. parahaemolyticus, on account of the false positive for V. vulnificus. However, the mis-reading was explained by the test against recommendation for tryptophan deaminase. V. vulnificus is one of the few Vibrio that tests positive for tryptophan deaminase in microsystems (Colodner et al., 2004). Re-testing would likely show the correct negative result and isolate V. parahaemolyticus as the preferred ID choice.

A subsequent nitrate reduction test showed red in the ONPG well when the first reagents were added. V. parahaemolyticus was positive for nitrate reduction, capable of producing the enzyme nitrate reductase. The presence of this enzyme allows this species to respire nitrate as an alternative in low-oxygen environments (Macfarlane & Herbert, 1982).

P. aeruginosa, A. faecalis and V. parahaemolyticus were all shown to be motile. Hanging drop analysis identified P. aeruginosa as polar and A. faecalis peritrichous. Although V. parahaemolyticus was also motile, flagellar type cannot be determined from motility plate agar alone (Tittsler & Sandholzer, 1936). Of species compared only C. meningosepticum lacked motility, supporting study expectations.

As hypothesised E. coli and K. pneumoniae were yellow with fissures while P. vulgaris and S. typhimurium were blacken (Bailey & Lacy, 1927). The yellow from butt to slant indicated that these Escherichia and Klebsiella ferment both lactose and glucose into acid. The fissures in the agarose show that during this process these species produce gas. In contrast, the Proteus and Salmonella species produce hydrogen sulphide, reducing the iron salts to black precipitate. Urea agar differentiated these two hydrogen sulphide producing bacteria. The urease enzyme splits urea to release ammonium. This raises the pH, causing a colour change from yellow to red due to the pH sensitive phenol red additive.

E. coli was positive on the Methyl Red test and K. pneumoniae on the Voges-Proskauer test. This supported the hypotheses and prior research (Campbell & Roth, 1975). The Methyl Red test meant that of the Enterobacteriaceae only E. coli fermented glucose into mixed acids. The mixed acid was sufficient to overwhelm a phosphate buffer and lower the pH, leading to a positive test result. A positive Voges-Proskauer test confirmed that only K. pneumoniae fermented glucose through a butanediol pathway. Acetoin produced from this fermentation is oxidised to diacetyl. This in turn shows a positive pink result when exposed to Voges-Proskauer test reagents. K. pneumoniae was hypothesised to return a positive Voges-Proskauer reaction (Campbell & Roth, 1975). The positive Indole tests for E. coli and P. vulgaris aligned with hypotheses for these bacteria (Li & Young, 2013). It showed that both produce the tryptophanase enzyme that can reduce tryptophan to indole. When Kovac's reagent is added, a red indole ring presents, signalling production of the upstream enzyme.

MacConkey agar plate results showed E. coli and K. pneumoniae were lactose fermenters. This was evidenced by prominent and distinct growth of each in this medium, and lack of growth for non-lactose fermenters P. vulgaris and S. typhimurium. They presented distinct morphologies, with E. coli being flat, red and dry, and K. pneumoniae raised, pink and mucoid. This was corroborated by Eosin Methylene Blue results where E. coli presented as metallic as expected. Strain variation could account for the slightly greater visibility of non-lactose fermenting S. typhimurium. The final XLD medium was selective for Salmonella. This was supported by characteristic glossy, convex domes and the absence of sugar fermentation. A lactose-sucrose-xylose mix enabled sugar fermentation for all the other Enterobacteriaceae, which do not require the glucose monomer. These results supported prior research and hypotheses (MacConkey, 1905; Levine, 1918; Taylor, 1965).

Future research may investigate what nutritional requirements in XLD agar produce the distinctive colonial morphology. It may also attempt to incorporate into the Microbact algorithm subspecies variations. For example, the magnitude of variation for one test (e.g. tryptophan deaminase) within a species.
